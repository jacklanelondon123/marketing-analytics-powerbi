   - Used DAX to calculate dynamic KPIs such as:  
     ```DAX
     ROI = (Revenue - Cost) / Cost
     Engagement Rate = (Clicks / Impressions) * 100
     ```

- **Social Media:** High impressions but low conversions — needs creative A/B testing and refined ad copy.  
- **Email Campaigns:** Strong **CTR (6.8%)** and high repeat engagement — excellent for customer retention.  
- **Geographical Split:** North America had the highest spend, but **Europe** achieved better conversion efficiency.
